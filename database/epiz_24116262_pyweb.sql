Examples of web applications are social networking sites like Facebook or e-commerce sites like Amazon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style="font-size:22px">Web Development Overview</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two broad divisions of web development &ndash; front-end development (also called client-side development) and back-end development (also called server-side development).Front-end development refers to constructing what a user sees when they load a web application &ndash; the content, design and how you interact with it. This is done with three codes &ndash; HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HTML, short for&nbsp;Hyper Text Markup Language, is a special code for &lsquo;marking up&rsquo; text in order to turn it into a web page. Every web page on the net is written in HTML, and it will form the backbone of any web application. CSS, short for&nbsp;Cascading Style Sheets, is a code for setting style rules for the appearance of web pages. CSS handles the cosmetic side of the web. Finally,&nbsp;JavaScript&nbsp;is a scripting language that&rsquo;s widely used to add functionality and interactivity to web pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back-end development controls what goes on behind the scenes of a web application. A back-end often uses a database to generate the front-end</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="background-color:#4e5f70">Here&rsquo;s an example. Say you log into your Facebook account, and you are greeted with the latest updates in your News Feed. They&rsquo;re not going to be the same updates that you saw yesterday.How did the page change? Did a Facebook employee manually edit the page to update your news feed? Of course not. A script on the Facebook back-end would have received the updates and re-generated the front-end accordingly.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back-end scripts are written in many different coding languages and frameworks, such as&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Python</li>\r\n	<li>Ruby on Rails</li>\r\n	<li>ASP.NET</li>\r\n	<li>Perl</li>\r\n	<li>Java</li>\r\n	<li>Node.js</li>\r\n	<li>PHP</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Without going into more detail, that&rsquo;s really all there is to web development. So now, here are the best ways to start learning it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:22px">Types of Web Developers</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier, we mentioned that web development work could be in the front end, the back end, or the full stack. What exactly do these terms mean?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:18px">The&nbsp;<strong>front end</strong></span>&nbsp;is the stuff you see on the website in your browser, including the presentation of content and user interface elements like the navigation bar. Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and their relevant frameworks to ensure that content is presented effectively and that users have an excellent experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:18px">The&nbsp;<strong>back end</strong></span>&nbsp;refers to the guts of the application, which live on the server. The back end stores and serves program data to ensure that the front end has what it needs. This process can become very complicated when a website has millions of users. Back-end developers use programming languages like Java, Python, and Ruby to work with data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Full-stack developers</strong></span>&nbsp;are comfortable working with both the front and back ends. In The Odin Project, we focus on teaching you full-stack development, covering all aspects of web development.</p>\r\n', 'WEB'),

It was the main challenge and concern for the enterprise industries until 2010. The main focus was on building framework and solutions to store data. Now when Hadoop and other frameworks have successfully solved the problem of storage, the focus has shifted to the processing of this data. Data Science is the secret sauce here. All the ideas which you see in Hollywood sci-fi movies can actually turn into reality by Data Science. Data Science is the future of Artificial Intelligence. Therefore, it is very important to understand what is Data Science and how can it add value to your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:22px">Let&rsquo;s Understand Why We Need Data Science</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Traditionally, the data that we had was mostly structured and small in size, which could be analyzed by using the simple BI tools.&nbsp;Unlike data in the&nbsp;traditional systems which was mostly structured, today most of the data is unstructured or semi-structured.

No doubt you had all this data earlier too, but now with the vast amount and variety of data, you can train models more effectively and recommend the product to your customers with more precision. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be amazing as it will bring more business to your organization?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Let&rsquo;s take a different scenario to understand the role of Data Science in&nbsp;decision making.&nbsp;How about if your car had the intelligence to drive you home?

Based on this data, it takes decisions like when to speed up, when to speed down, when to overtake, where to take a turn &ndash; making use of advanced machine learning algorithms.</li>\r\n	<li>Let&rsquo;s see how Data Science can be used in predictive analytics. Let&rsquo;s take weather forecasting as an example. Data from ships, aircrafts, radars, satellites can be collected and analyzed to build models. These models will not only forecast the weather but also help in predicting the occurrence of any natural calamities. It will help you to take appropriate measures beforehand and save many precious lives.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at the below infographic to see all the domains where Data Science is creating its impression.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="" src="https://www.edureka.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Data-Science-use-cases.png" style="height:215px; max-width:75vw" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style="font-size:22px">What is Data Science?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Use of the term Data Science is increasingly common<em>,&nbsp;</em>but what does it exactly mean?

Data Science is a blend of various tools, algorithms,&nbsp;and machine learning principles&nbsp;with the goal to discover hidden patterns from the raw data.

But another important feature of Python is that it can be easily extended with C/C++. This feature helps us to write computationally intensive codes in C/C++ and create a Python wrapper for it so that we can use these wrappers as Python modules. This gives us two advantages: first, our code is as fast as original C/C++ code (since it is the actual C++ code working in background) and second, it is very easy to code in Python.
